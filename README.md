Website visualizing data gathered from the Bee Movie thread on r/AskOuija

Hello and welcome to my repo

This website was built with Node.js using Pug and Express
The data comes from a mariadb populated via a couple scrapers i built
  https://github.com/MasterfulPleb/bee-movie-comment-scraper
  & https://github.com/MasterfulPleb/bee-movie-comment-updater

The typescript is completely unnecessary i just wanted to give it a shot

The server is in liveobb.js
the charts are built by the ts module found at types/src/build-charts.ts
