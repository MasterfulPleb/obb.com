Hello and welcome to my repo

This website was built with Node.js using Pug and Express

The data comes from a mariadb populated via a couple scrapers i built -

  https://github.com/MasterfulPleb/bee-movie-comment-scraper
  & https://github.com/MasterfulPleb/bee-movie-comment-updater

The typescript is completely unnecessary i just wanted to try it out a bit

The server is in liveobb.js

the charts are built by the ts module found at types/src/build-charts.ts
